    Pairwise operations and prime multiplications are used to map hands to keys.
    A precomputed lookup table is used to map hand keys to ranks. Multiple hands can correspond to the same rank.
    There are only 7462 possible ranks.

    It may be possible to avoid conditional branches by mapping hands to comparable numeric keys.
    Considering all the "possible" hands deriving from a set of 7 cards and retaining the highest one...

    The descending order of side cards is important for the lexicographic
